  "transcript": "Hey there! Are you ready for today's story? Let's go! Read with me as we make the world more magical one story at a time. Melissa was a little girl who was quiet and shy. She was often lonely and didn't know why. When she tried to make friends, she didn't succeed. For Melissa, making friends was very hard indeed. One day, she saw children playing in a sand pit. She wanted to join them but chose to avoid it. Melissa felt shy, timid and insecure too. She didn't know what to say or what to do. Just as she was about to go away, a girl invited little Melissa to play. She said, \"Come and So she ruined the castle and left the sandpit. Melissa ran home and hugged her teddy. To fall asleep, the little girl was ready. \"Teddy, you're the only friend I need.\" Melissa said and meant it indeed. The dream took them to a tropical place. Melissa felt the hot sun on her face. Welcome to the jungle of friendship! She heard. The girls saw not just one giraffe, but a whole herd. You will make a lot of friends here. Come and meet the others, my dear. The giraffe said, but Melissa replied, \"No. How to make friends I simply don't know.\" Start the conversation by asking a name. Simply saying hello can lead to a game. You have a nice toy is also a good way. You might offer snacks or invite them to play. Those are some of the ways that I use. There are many others from which to choose. You might try a different way for each friend. Choose the one that suits you best in the end. Later, they saw two zebras at play. Melissa decided to try the hello way. She introduced herself, offering her name, and both of the zebras did the same. \"Hello!\" \"We love hopscotch! What about you? You can join us and bring your teddy too!\" The zebra said, and they began to play. Melissa thought, \"What a good way!\" Melissa lost the game, but what a surprise! The little girl could hardly believe her eyes. One of the zebras who lost the game too, said to the winner, \"I'm so happy for you!\" True friends share both good and bad. Our friend's happiness makes us feel glad. We played her game and now we'll play mine. Let's race!\" said the zebra and drew a start line. Such good friends, Melissa thought. The little girl admired the zebras a lot. Then she met a monkey in the park. He was sad because he got a bad mark. His friend said, \"I'll help you in the afternoon. Later, we might play or watch a cartoon.\" The little monkey replied, \"I'm no longer sad. You always cheer me up and make me glad.\" Melissa said, \"You are a great friend indeed.\" He replied, \"I always help a friend in need. We support each other when we have trouble. The love we get in return is not equal, but double.\" Then, the giraffe took Melissa for a walk. She saw a lion and started the talk. \"Hello, how are you?\" \"You can run so fast. What do you like to do?\" They both loved to draw and to ride a bike too. The giraffe said, \"Melissa, I'm so proud of you!\" Now, you know a few ways to make friends, but that is not where your mission ends. Offer help and support if friends are upset. True friendship is the best gift you can get! Melissa saw many different animals around. They were playing together on the ground. With glasses or long necks, chubby and short, the animals didn't mind each other's sort. I'll get my stars!\" said Melissa. \"They will be so bright! My friendship stars will light up the sky every night!\" After Melissa had some more fun and play, it was time to wake up and start a new day. Melissa ran to the park and called out her name, then asked other children to join in the game. She enjoyed playing. She had lots of fun. Melissa made many friends, not only one. Be kind and say sorry when you are wrong. That way, your friendship will last very long. Friendship is built star by star, day by day. So, ask yourself, \"Has my star shown today?\" Thank you so much for staying and reading with me until the end. Please give this a thumbs up if you enjoyed this and share it with your friends so we can all read along together. See you on our next one! Bye!",
